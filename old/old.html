                    <p class="text-white">
                        In the preface, I defined emergence as simply as possible: order arising out of chaos. A more nuanced definition is higher-order complexity arising out of chaos in which novel, coherent structures coalesce through interactions among the diverse entities of a system. Emergence occurs when these interactions disrupt, causing the system to differentiate and ultimately coalesce into something novel.
                        Key elements of this definition are chaos and novelty. Chaos is random interactions among different entities in a given context. Think of people at a cocktail party. Chaos contains no clear patterns or rules of interaction. Make that a cocktail party in which no single culture prevails, so that no one is sure how close to stand to others, whether to make eye contact, or whether to use first or last names. Emergent order arises when a novel, more complex system forms. It often happens in an unexpected, almost magical leap. The cocktail party is actually a surprise party, and everyone knows where to hide and when to sing “Happy Birthday.”
                        Emergence produces novel systems—coherent interactions among entities following basic principles. In his bestseller Emergence, science writer Steven Johnson puts it this way: “Agents residing on one scale start producing behavior that lies one scale above them: ants create colonies; urbanites create neighborhoods; simple pattern-recognition software learns how to recommend new books.”1 Emergence in human systems has produced new technologies, towns, democracy, and some would say consciousness—the capacity for self-reflection.

                <p class="s1-header">3. Feedback</p>
                Feedback is what makes systems so hard to predict and complicated to solve. Feedback is basically
                when A influences B which then infleunces A.
                The common perspective of viewing the world is the through linear cause-and-effect thinking.
                When we think in linear terms, we see the world as a series of events that trigger other events.
                It's only through the feedback loop perspective that we can start to see the underlying structure of
                these systems and how our actions feed back into them.
                Thinking in feedback loops helps us see the inter-relation between parts of the system in a way that
                linear thinking can't.
                "Systems thinking is not linear, it happens not in a straight line — it happens in cycles, loops, contours. All parts of the system are connected, so a change in one part generates waves of changes that reach all other parts. Thus, the action returns to the starting point in a modified form: so we have a loop. It is called a feedback loop. All our experience is formed as a result of such actions. The phrase “feedback” is often used to designate any reaction, but in reality, it means the perception of the result of our actions affecting subsequent actions, i.e. two-way communication. Our experience is formed as a result of actions of this kind of feedback loops, although we are used to seeing the only one-way influence. The presence of feedback is an integral characteristic of a system. No feedback means no system.
                There are two main types of feedback:
                Reinforcing feedback: a change in system state which serves as a signal to enhance the initial change. In other words, the system provides a big change in the same direction.
                Balancing feedback: a change in system state which serves as a signal to start moving in the opposite direction in order to restore the lost balance."
                In the next section, I'll discuss a few common feedback loops."

                        Reinforcement Loops happen when a change in one direction leads to even more change in that
                        direction. The changes compound over time. A popular example of this is the interest rate.
                        The more money you have in the account, the more interest you get, the more money you have
                        in the account.
                        If these loops persist for long enough, they can lead to rapid improvements or falls. They
                        are extremely fragile at the beginning but grow stronger over time.
                        https://deming.org/systems-thinking-feedback-loops/
                        "A reinforcing loop encourages the system to continue in that direction (e.g. a damn starting to leak. As water flows over the damn wall, it will further erode the wall which leads to more water flowing over causing more erosion).
                        When the reinforcing loop is undesirable, it can be referred to as a vicious cycle. This would be something that you would want to avoid if possible. Design the system to avoid reinforcing loops that push results in the wrong direction. When you can’t design that away, create processes that provide notice when things are moving in the wrong direction. Then institute countermeasures to avoid the natural result that the reinforcing loop would provide.
                        Sometimes you can design the process to have countermeasures automatically take place if conditions start moving in the wrong direction.
                        When the reinforcing loop is a desired result, then we want to design the system to encourage things to continue to move in that direction. Sometimes it can be useful to think of it as having a bit of inertia, but as you put in some effort to get things going, then it gathers momentum and can produce more and more benefit for very little effort (like rolling something down a hill).
                        An example of a positive reinforcing loop is building trust in an organization. As people gain trust (and fear reduces), people are more willing to be trusting and cooperate; that behavior then encourages more of that behavior and so on. A positive reinforcing loop can be called a virtuous cycle."

                        Balancing loops are continually trying to keep the system at some desired level of performance. The
                        best example is a Thermostat. It'll be on when the room is colder than the set temperature then turn

                        "Balancing loops will encourage the system to stay in balance (e.g. eating will cause you to feel full and stop eating, while not eating will cause you to feel hungry and start eating).
                        If you have a specific desired result, you can design a system to include natural balancing loops that achieve the desired result. Doing so is making good use of systems thinking. This is often how balancing loops are portrayed, but they can also result in stubborn resistance to improvement. It can be that the balancing loop is balanced, not at a desired state, but at a less than desired state.
                        Organizations in fire-fighting mode can often fall into this trap. When there is a crisis, direct resources to address that crisis can return results to at least a non-crisis level. At that point, what an organization based on Deming management system would want to do is consider if that crisis is an indication of a bad system that we should spend resources to examine and improve. Often people say this is what they do, but it isn’t, normally; at best they slap on band-aids and move on.
                        In the all too common fire-fighting management system organization, what often happens is there is a new crisis and resources must be directed to that. What actually can end up happening is if any area is performing well, they are able to have resources taken away and used to address the crisis. So, if certain areas start to do well, there are balancing forces to bring down their performance (losing resources to accomplish the tasks). And poor areas get temporary infusions of resources to bring levels from a crisis to less poor (but rarely to actually good results because as they move in that direction, some other crisis needs attention).
                        I explained how well our organization fit this model to one of my bosses at one point. He didn’t like that idea at all. I tried to tell him he didn’t want to hear what I had to say several times, but he insisted so I told him. It was in relation to what I learned at the Hunter Conference on Quality (named for my father, W. Edwards Deming spoke at the inaugural conference) at which I attended several sessions on systems thinking. Sure, I could have avoided telling him, but after he insisted, I felt it is better to share my ideas with management; maybe they would actually listen. But they didn’t. I left in a year or so."

                Feedback is what makes systems so hard to predict and complicated to solve. Feedback is basically when A influences B which then infleunces A. 
                The common perspective of viewing the world is the through linear cause-and-effect thinking. 
                When we think in linear terms, we see the world as a series of events that trigger other events.
                It's only through the feedback loop perspective that we can start to see the underlying structure of these systems and how our actions feed back into them.
                Thinking in feedback loops helps us see the inter-relation between parts of the system in a way that linear thinking can't.

                In the next section, I'll discuss a few common feedback loops.
